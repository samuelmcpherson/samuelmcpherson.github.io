    responsibilities:
    - Created a separate VLAN for testing improvements to our internal processes. This environment included the servers and tools that we use for processing incoming customer devices by securely wiping all storage devices and preparing these devices for in depth testing. This allowed for safely creating many improvements to these processes and the ability to address issues without interruptions to our production enviroments.

    - Rewrote a bash script to automatically wipe all customer data from an Apple computer and deploy the correct version of MacOS while collecting all relevant system information and setting the unit up for testing. This script is central to our process for all apple computers that we process. The rewrite improved the reliability of the process and has allowed me to make continuous improvements to keep up with changes to the Apple product line while maintaining this tool.

    - Setup of Proxmox Virtual Environment as a replacement for VMWare ESXI. This included the integration of our existing Solaris based SAN to provide backend storage using ISCSI with LVM, as well as the configuration of a three node virtualisation cluster supporting live migration and automatic failover of virtual machines.    

    - Setup of internal IT wiki using Wikijs with a PostgreSQL backend. This process also included creating bash scripts to automatically backup the database contents nightly using pgdump as well as scripts to quickly re-create the Wikijs installation and restore from this backup on a new Linux system. 

    - Created of bash scripts to automate the configuration and setup of key Linux servers. These scripts would fully configure a Debian based Linux server from a fresh install for it's intended purpose.

    - Created scripts to check battery health and peform CPU load testing for units. These scripts were hosted on an AWS EC2 instance for availability on our testing networks with no internal access using NFS. This improved the efficiency of our testing and repair departments. 

    - Maintained well organized private repositories on GitHub for all scripts, configuration files, and projects for the IT department.
